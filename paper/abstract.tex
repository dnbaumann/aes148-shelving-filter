A shelving filter that exhibits an adjustable transition band is derived from a
cascade of second order infinite impulse response shelving filters.
%
Two of three parameters, i.e. shelving level, transition slope and
transition bandwidth, can be freely adjusted in order to describe the design
specifications.
%
The accuracy of the resulting response depends on the number of
deployed biquads per octave.
%
If this is set too small, deviations in level and bandwidth as well as a rippled
slope can occur.
%
The shelving filter cascade might be used in applications,
that require a fractional-order slope in a certain bandwidth,
such as for sound reinforcement system equalization, sound field synthesis
and audio production.
